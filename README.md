# Word counting Web-API using FastAPI and Uvicorn

This project is a simple web-API built with FastAPI and Uvicorn that provides a word-counting functionality, following the principles of a RESTful API. 
The user can send an input in the format of a text of choice, via a POST request, and the web-API then returs the frequency of each unique word in the text in JSON format. 

This application is developed to automatically reload on code changes, making it easy to manage and compatible for future updates. 
The application can also handle requests asynchronously, to be able to handle large number of users simultaneously.

## Technologies used
FastAPI is a high-performance web framework for developing APIs with Python3, and is on level with NodeJS. The app runs on Uvicorn, which is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) server.
